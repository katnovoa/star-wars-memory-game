# Memory Game Project

## What is the Star Wars Memory Game
This is a game build to test a users memory using  deck of  16 cards with different icons.
As a passionate Star Wars fan, I wanted to pay a little tribute by making the cards glow like lightsabers, red for no match and blue when cards match. 

## Challenge
The object of the game is to match each pair of cards in less moves and less time

## Game Instructions

* Click on two cards at a time, flip over to see if they match.
* Continue to click on cards and use memory to match each pair.
* Match pairs with less moves and in less time.
* You can reset the game at any time.
